title: "SOME EXAMPLES OF HIGHER INDUCTIVE TYPE"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-12-10-higher-inductive-type
excerpt: 'Homotopy type theory is a theory axiomatize equality and also links type theory with geometry. In HoTT, types are interpreted as spaces. In HoTT we could generate the idea of inductive type to higher inductive by allowing define constructor to construct equalities. Here, we define and study higher inductive types in order to present some well-known and useful types and implement it in cubical Agda. We define integers as a HIT and show that it forms an Abelian group when equipped with addition. We also introduce two different definitions of the notion of free group on a set and show that they are equivalent. Finally, study two HIT definitions of symmetric groups: the "natural" one (which corresponds to the standard presentation by transpositions) and one which correspond to some "normal form" for symmetries, called Lehmer codes. We construct a map from the later to the former, and conjecture that it is part of an equivalence.'

Homotopy type theory is a theory axiomatize equality and also links type theory with geometry. In HoTT, types are interpreted as spaces. In HoTT we could generate the idea of inductive type to higher inductive by allowing define constructor to construct equalities. Here, we define and study higher inductive types in order to present some well-known and useful types and implement it in cubical Agda. We define integers as a HIT and show that it forms an Abelian group when equipped with addition. We also introduce two different definitions of the notion of free group on a set and show that they are equivalent. Finally, study two HIT definitions of symmetric groups: the "natural" one (which corresponds to the standard presentation by transpositions) and one which correspond to some "normal form" for symmetries, called Lehmer codes. We construct a map from the later to the former, and conjecture that it is part of an equivalence.
